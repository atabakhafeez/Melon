## What it does
Turn on NFC on your Android phones and if logged in to Twitter and/or Facebook, automatically add eachother/follow without having to go to specific accounts. 

## Issues
The functionality is still incomplete due to lack of API support for friend requests and follows from both Facebook and Twitter. Currently, the app logs in to both accounts and sends data using NFC, but thats all.
